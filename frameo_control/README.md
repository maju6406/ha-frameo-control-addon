# Legacy Home Assistant Add-on (Deprecated)

> [!WARNING]
> **This Home Assistant add-on structure is deprecated.** This project has been redesigned as a standalone API and CLI tool.

This folder contains legacy Home Assistant add-on files. For the current standalone API and CLI, please use the main project:

**Current Project:** [Frameo Control API](https://github.com/maju6406/frameo-control-api)

The standalone version provides:
- REST API server (no HA dependency)
- Powerful CLI tool
- Better Docker support
- Broader integration options
